need golang rest api that stores ip addresses in an sqlite backend. It uses standard net http library for routing. The api must take input of cidr, tenant_name, purpose. Purpose must be on of these values: host, gateway, dns, vip. There must be an endpoint for reserving the ip in the cidr. the tenant + cidr + IP must be unique in the backend. there must be an endpoint for releasing the ip based on the tenant, cidr, and IP address. The existence of an ip in the backend means it is not available. the absence of an ip address in the backend means it is available.
